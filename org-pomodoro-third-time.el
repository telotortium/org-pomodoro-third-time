;;; org-pomodoro-third-time.el --- Adapt ‘org-pomodoro' to implement Third Time -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Robert Irelan <rirelan@gmail.com>
;; URL: https://github.com/telotortium/org-pomodoro-third-time
;; Created: Feb 8, 2022
;; Version: 0.1
;; Package-Requires: ((org-pomodoro "2.1.0") (emacs "26"))

;;; Commentary:

;; This package adapts the ‘org-pomodoro’ package to implement work and break
;; intervals from the Third Time system introduced in
;; https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RWu8eZqbwgB9zaerh/third-time-a-better-way-to-work
;;
;; When this package is activated, ‘org-pomodoro-short-break-length’ is
;; automatically calculated to be ‘org-pomodoro-third-time-break-to-work-ratio’
;; times ‘org-pomodoro-length’. The length of the next break is adjusted based
;; on whether you start the next Pomodoro before or after the scheduled break
;; end.
;;
;; Long breaks are never scheduled automatically, but you can manually start
;; one, in which case any break time adjustments are reset.

(require 'org-pomodoro)

The default Third Break configuration sets this to 1/3 = 0.333..., which means
the `org-pomodoro' break is set to be one-third the length of the just finished
work period. If the Pomodoro has been ended early or later than
‘org-pomodoro-length', either by setting ‘org-pomodoro-manual-break’ or by
calling ‘org-pomodoro-end-in', the break time will be this fraction of the
modified Pomodoro time.

(defcustom org-pomodoro-third-time-minimum-break-length 1.0
  "The minimum break length, in minutes.

If you end a break early or late, the difference is accumulated in a “bank” and
added to the break length calculated using
‘org-pomodoro-third-time--validate-break-to-work-ratio'.

The bank can be positive or negative. For example, if the calculated break
length is 3 minutes, but you actually don’t start the next Pomodoro for 5
minutes, 2 minutes are subtracted from the bank. If the bank had 0 minutes, the
bank’s balance would then be -2 minutes.

If the bank is too negative, adding it to the default break length would produce
a break of very short or even negative length. This variable sets the minimum
break time in this situation.

The bank balance is set to 0 minutes after applying the bank balance, whether
the resulting break time is above or below this minimum."
